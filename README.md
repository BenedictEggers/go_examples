go_examples
===========

Examples of stuff in Go. All files should be runnable from the repo directory with the command `go run file.go`. Many of these were written to explore some aspect of the language/standard library, some were deliberately written to show a cool feature of the language.

Think there's something I missed? Write it and submit a pull request!
